SparkFun Mega Pro Mini - 3.3V
========================================

[*SparkFun Mega Pro Mini - 3.3V (DEV-10743)*](https://www.sparkfun.com/products/10743)

 This is a 3.3V microcontroller running a version of the stk500v2 bootloader at 8MHz. 
 In order to shrink the Mega Pro down to its minimum footprint, weâ€™ve condensed the board layout, removed the barrel jack footprint and replaced the traditional Arduino-style headers with compact vertical JST connectors.
